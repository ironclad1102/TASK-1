# TASK-1

I cleaned the "Netflix Movies and TV Shows" dataset in Excel by using filters to identify and handle missing values. I removed duplicate rows with the “Remove Duplicates” feature. I standardized text values, like gender and country names, for consistency. I reformatted dates to a uniform style (e.g., dd-mm-yyyy) and renamed column headers to be clean and uniform, using lowercase and removing spaces. I also checked and adjusted data types, ensuring fields like age were numeric and dates were properly formatted. These steps improved the dataset’s quality for analysis.
